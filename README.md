## 📌 Project Overview

**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is a web-based tool to visually demonstrate the inner workings of sorting algorithms. This tool provides users with the ability to interactively explore how different sorting algorithms work by watching animations of the sorting process. The visualizations aim to make it easier to understand sorting algorithms step-by-step.

> 🌟 Currently, only **Bubble Sort** is available for visualization.
